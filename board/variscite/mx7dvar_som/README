$ make mx7dvar_som_defconfig
$ make

To build U-Boot for NAND flash:

$ make mx7dvar_som_nand_defconfig
$ make

To build U-Boot for SD card/eMMC (Android):

$ make mx7dvar_som_android_defconfig
$ make

To build U-Boot for NAND flash (Android):

$ make mx7dvar_som_nand_android_defconfig
$ make


Flashing U-Boot to an SD card
-----------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, flash the generated U-Boot
binary into the SD card:

$ sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=1; sync

(replace /dev/sdX with your correct device node)

- Insert the SD card into the slot

- Connect the debug cable to the host PC

- Make sure the boot select switches are on SD

- Power up the board and U-Boot messages will appear in the serial console.
